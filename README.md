# Inventory-Management-Supply-chain
This project presents an interactive Inventory Management Dashboard built using Power BI, designed to provide actionable insights into stock levels, supplier performance, and product restocking trends.
It helps businesses monitor stock availability, identify top-performing categories, analyze supplier lead times, and optimize restocking decisions.

 # Presentation Experience
 Presenting this dashboard was an exciting opportunity to dive deeper into analytical storytelling. I focused on connecting dots between data patterns and real supply chain decisions using DAX, clean design, and user friendly interactions.
For this Power BI project, I worked with a dynamic inventory dataset and designed an interactive, insight-rich dashboard. My goal was simple: empower smarter decision making with real-time product and supply chain intelligence.
